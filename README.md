These are a collection of sorts I've made since I started learning C. All have been updated to my present knowledge of C, however.
In the tarball, you can see the _original_ sorts I made - some of them are from back when I barely knew any C, and as such, the way some of them are written is god-awful.
I won't explain how each of the sorts work because there is enough information online already.
